# Echoes-of-Blue
a little game I'm making :3

# Changelog

## v0.0.1
First version woo!
- Steam networking to host and join lobbies
- Single player mode
- In multiplayer must have the same major version and hash (hash not yet implemented) to connect. The hash is for the purpose of modding/custom versions or if I ever get lazy and add a piglin brute on a minor version
- Character movement and animation, running and sneaking
- Opening and closing map, and using the map to change locations (although there is no location logic)
- World and map tilesets, beautiful!
